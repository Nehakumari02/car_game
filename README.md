When the Up Arrow Key is pressed, the car moves upward in the game. Similarly, when other directional keys are pressed, such as the Left Arrow Key for leftward movement, 
the Right Arrow Key for rightward movement, and the Down Arrow Key for moving the car in the opposite direction, the vehicle responds accordingly to the player's input.


The rules for the game are simple, just save the car from striking with the cars . The player loses whenever the car touches the car.
